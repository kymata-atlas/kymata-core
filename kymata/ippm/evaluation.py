    Assumption: expression points are denoised. Otherwise, it doesn't really make sense to check the min/max latency of
    noisy expression points.

    A score calculated on denoised expression points that calculates the proportion of arrows in IPPM that are going
    backward in time. It assumes that the function hierarchy is correct, which may not always be correct, so you must
    use it with caution.

    """
    This is the second scoring metric: transform recall. It illustrates what proportion out of functions in the
    noisy spikes are detected as part of IPPM. E.g., 9 functions but only 8 found => 8/9 = function recall. Use this
    along with causality violation to evaluate IPPMs and analyse their strengths and weaknesses.

    One thing to note is that the recall depends upon the nature of the dataset. If certain functions have no
    significant spikes, there is an inherent bias present in the dataset. We can never get the function recall to be
    perfect no matter what algorithm we employ. Therefore, the function recall is based on what we can actually do
    with a dataset. E.g., 9 functions in the hierarchy but in the noisy spikes we find only 7 of the 9 functions.
    Moreover, after denoising we find that there are only 6 functions in the hierarchy. The recall will be 6/7
    rather than 6/9 since there were only 7 to be found to begin with.

    Params
    ------
    ippm: The IPPM graph to evaluate.
    noisy_points: the ExpressionPoints in the original (not denoised) dataset

    Returns
    -------
    A ratio indicating how many transforms were incorporated into the IPPM out of all relevant transforms.
    (ratio, num, denom)

    In case the denominator is 0, the ratio will be set to 0 rather than raise an exception.

        CONCEPTUAL EXPLANATION: what proportion of null edges across both maps is extra or missing? This is the question this metric answers
        If you get 0, then the maps agree perfectly on the null edges
        If you get 1, then the maps disagree completely on the null edges.
        If you get (0, 1), then the maps partially agree on the null edges.
