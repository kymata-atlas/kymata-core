        Builds a dictionary of nodes and information about the node. The information

        Args:
            hexels (Dict[str, IPPMHexel]): Dictionary containing function names and Hexel objects with data in it.

            inputs (List[str]): List of input functions. function_hier contains the input functions, so we need this
                                to distinguish between inputs and functions.
            hemi (str): 'leftHemisphere' or 'rightHemisphere'.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, Node]: A dictionary of nodes with unique names where the keys are node objects with all
                             relevant information for plotting a graph.

        Analysis:
            The overall complexity of the algorithm is O(f * nlogn) where:

             - f is the number of functions.
             - n is the number of hexels.

            The sorting step takes O(f * nlogn).

            Looping through functions and parents contributes O(f * n + f^2).

            Space Complexity:

             - Total space complexity is O(f * n), which includes copies of hexels and function hierarchy.

            The analysis section provides detailed reasoning for the complexities.

        Algorithm:
            The algorithm iteratively selects the top-level function, defined as a function that does not
            have any children (no outgoing arrows). It starts with the final function and proceeds
            in a top-down fashion towards the input node. Each selected top-level function creates a spike for every
            pairing in the best_pairings. Edges are added from the final function of each parent to the first current
            function, repeating for all functions. The input node is treated differently with a default size of 10 at
            latency 0.
