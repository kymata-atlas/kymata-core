    Represents an actual IPPM graph, with nodes relating to actual expression points. Built from a

    This class constructs a directed graph (DiGraph) where nodes are ExpressionPoints, and edges are dependencies
    between those points based on the candidate transform list. The graph is constructed by sorting points by latency
    and adding edges according to the predecessors and successors of the transforms.

    The exception to the statement that nodes relate to actual expression points are the input nodes, which are allowed
    to not be associated with any true datapoints, in which case they are assumed to be direct sensory inputs with a
    latency of 0ms by definition. In other words, transforms which are inputs (no predecessors) in

    ExpressionPoints in `points`.
