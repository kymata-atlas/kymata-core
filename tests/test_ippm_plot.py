"""
Testing Philosophy for IPPM plotting functionality
==================================
It is a pain to test matplotlib plotting works correctly. Therefore, we will omit testing
that code since it will be tested by actively using the IPPM module.

On the other hand, rather than have no tests at all, we can still test the numerical computations
even though they are private functions.
